    /**
     * Calls one of your app's own server routes with this client's credentials attached.
     *
     * Base44 keeps a user's access token in the browser's local storage, and the platform puts its own headers on a server request — so a plain `fetch()` to your app's routes carries neither, and the route sees an anonymous caller with no way to build a client. `fetchWithAuth()` is the same `fetch()` with whatever this client holds added, which is what lets the route act on behalf of the caller.
     *
     * What that means depends on where the client came from, because a client can only send what it has:
     *
     * - In a browser, from {@linkcode createClient | createClient()}: the signed-in user's `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. When nobody is signed in the request goes without it, so routes open to anonymous callers keep working.
     * - In one of your server routes, from {@linkcode createClientFromRequest | createClientFromRequest()}: everything that function reads back — the caller's token, `Base44-App-Id`, `Base44-Api-Url`, `Base44-Functions-Version`, the signed `Base44-State`, `X-Data-Env`, and the app's per-request service credential. The callee's own `createClientFromRequest()` then rebuilds the client you are holding, service role included.
     *
     * That second case is why route-to-route calls need this. A sub-request carries nothing from the request that triggered it — your framework builds it from your arguments alone — so a route reached by a plain `fetch()` sees no headers at all and its `createClientFromRequest()` throws on the missing `Base44-App-Id`.
     *
     * Requests are restricted to your app's own origin, which is what keeps these credentials inside your app: pass a relative path beginning with a single `/`, such as `/api/orders`. An absolute URL, a protocol-relative `//host`, or anything else a URL parser would read as another origin throws. To call a Base44 backend function, use {@linkcode FunctionsModule.fetch | functions.fetch()}; for another origin, use plain `fetch()`.
     *
     * Two routes that need the same logic should call a shared function rather than each other — cheaper than an HTTP round trip, and it needs no headers at all. Hop when the hop is the point: rendering a page server-side, or going through a route for its own caching and route rules.
     *
     * @param path - A relative path on your app's own origin, such as `/api/orders`.
     * @param init - Optional [`RequestInit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit) options such as `method`, `headers`, `body`, and `signal`, plus `fetch`: the transport that resolves a root-relative path against your app's routes. It defaults to the global `fetch`, which does that in a browser but not on a server — in Nitro pass its own (`import { fetch } from "nitro"`), which dispatches in-process with no network hop. Any header you set yourself is kept, so you can deliberately hand the callee a different identity.
     * @returns Promise resolving to a native [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).
     * @throws {Error} When `path` is not a relative path on your app's own origin.
