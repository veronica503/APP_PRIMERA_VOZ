/**
 * Connectors module for managing OAuth tokens for external services.
 *
 * Unlike the {@link IntegrationsModule | integrations} module that provides pre-built functions, connectors give you raw OAuth tokens so you can call external service APIs directly. Use this when you need custom API interactions that the pre-built integrations do not cover.
 *
 * There are two connector types, depending on whether the token is shared across the app or specific to each user:
 *
 * - **[Shared connectors](#shared-connectors):** A single OAuth token shared by all app users. Best for shared service accounts.
 * - **[App user connectors](#app-user-connectors):** Each app user has their own OAuth token. Best for actions that need to happen as the individual user.
 *
 * ## Shared connectors
 *
 * All app users share a single OAuth token. Use this for shared accounts. For example, posting to a company Slack channel or reading from a shared Google Calendar.
 *
 * Shared connectors come in two forms, depending on how the connector is set up. Both return the same app-wide token, so they differ only in how you identify the connector in code:
 *
 * - **Platform connectors** are connected from the app's Integration settings or with the [`connectors push`](/developers/references/cli/commands/connectors-push) CLI command, and are identified by an [integration type](#available-connectors) string. Retrieve them with {@linkcode getConnection | getConnection()}.
 * - **Workspace-registered connectors** are backed by your own OAuth app, registered once in Workspace Settings and consented to by the app builder. They are identified by a connector ID instead of an integration type. Retrieve them with {@linkcode getWorkspaceConnection | getWorkspaceConnection()}. Connectors whose OAuth app is specific to your own account, such as Databricks and Snowflake, work this way.
 *
 * To use a shared connector, call the matching method on the service role client `base44.asServiceRole.connectors` from a backend function, then use the returned `accessToken` to call the external service's API directly. Some connectors also return a `connectionConfig` with additional values, such as a subdomain, that you need to build the API URL.
 *
 * ## App user connectors
 *
 * Each signed-in app user has their own OAuth token. Use this when each user needs to act as themselves. For example, sending emails from their Gmail account or posting to their personal LinkedIn. To use an app user connector:
 *
 * 1. Register OAuth credentials for the service in Workspace Settings to get a **connector ID**. This requires workspace admin access.
 * 2. From the frontend, call [connectAppUser()](#connectappuser) with the connector ID to get an authorization URL, then redirect the app user to that URL to complete the OAuth flow.
 * 3. In a backend function, call {@linkcode getCurrentAppUserConnection | getCurrentAppUserConnection()} using the service role client (`base44.asServiceRole.connectors`) with the connector ID to retrieve the app user's token.
 * 4. Use the returned `accessToken` to call the external service's API directly. Some connectors also return a `connectionConfig` with additional values such as a subdomain for building the API URL.
 *
 * ## Metered connectors
 *
 * A few [platform connectors](#shared-connectors) are backed by paid third-party APIs that charge Base44 per call. For those, the OAuth token is **not** available to your code — {@linkcode getConnection | getConnection()} rejects with a `403`. Call them with {@linkcode callApi | callApi()} instead: Base44 attaches the credential server-side, forwards the request, and bills your workspace's integration credits for the call.
 *
 * This applies to platform connectors only. A workspace-registered or app user connector runs on **your own** OAuth app, so the provider invoices you directly and there is nothing for Base44 to meter — those keep normal token access via {@linkcode getWorkspaceConnection | getWorkspaceConnection()} and {@linkcode getCurrentAppUserConnection | getCurrentAppUserConnection()}.
 *
 * Two things to keep in mind when writing against a metered connector:
 *
 * - **Cost varies by endpoint, sometimes sharply.** The same connector can charge two orders of magnitude more for one endpoint than another, so avoid putting an expensive call inside a loop and batch wherever the provider supports it. Each response reports what it actually cost as `creditsCharged`.
 * - **Provider and transport outcomes are returned, not thrown.** A provider `4xx`/`5xx` or a connection failure comes back as `success: false` with its `phase`; authorization, quota, and invalid proxy requests reject the promise.
 * - **Only `phase: 'not_sent'` proves the provider did not execute the request.** A timeout or in-flight failure may have executed upstream, so do not automatically retry a non-idempotent call unless the provider supports an idempotency key.
 *
 * ## Available connectors
 *
 * The connectors below can be used as shared connectors or as app user connectors. For a shared platform connector, pass the integration type string to {@linkcode getConnection | getConnection()}. For a connector you register in Workspace Settings with your own OAuth app, use the connector ID with {@linkcode getWorkspaceConnection | getWorkspaceConnection()} for a shared token, or with {@linkcode getCurrentAppUserConnection | getCurrentAppUserConnection()} for a per-user token.
